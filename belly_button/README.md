## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Dashboard](https://aricciardelli2.github.io/belly_button) is to provide an interactable webpage for users to see relevant belly button bacteria data for a particular subject from the full set of belly button [data](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/aricciardelli2.github.io/blob/master/belly_button/samples.json). The belly button bacteria cultures are being researched as possible sources for the next vegan meat and could be a gold mine for the subject!!

## User Flow

The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Dashboard [webpage](https://aricciardelli2.github.io/belly_button) allows for a user to filter to their subject ID (or any other subject ID) from the dropdown menu and visualize the subject meta data, sample information, and the number of times the subject washes.

### Demographic Info
The Demographi Info portion lists the ID number, ethnicity, gender, age, location, belly button type, and washing frequency for each subject.

### Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
The Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found portion shows the 10 ten bacteria cultures found in the subject's belly button by quantity in a horizontal bar chart. The bacteria are ordered descending, with the bacteria with the highest quantity at the top and the bacteria with the 10th highest quantity at the bottom.

### Belly Button Washing Frequency
The Belly Button Washing Frequency portion shows the number of the times the subject washes per week in a gauge. The quantity as a large number in the center of the gauge as well as a black bar against the colored gauge.

### Bacteria per Sample

The Bacteria per Sample portion shows the quantity of each bacteria sample found in the subject's belly button. The circles are sized by quantity of the bacteria culture with the larger the cirle, the higher the quantity of the culture.

## Summary

The [Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Dashboard](https://aricciardelli2.github.io/belly_button) is a great source for subjects to view their relevant belly button bacteria data and information to determine if their belly button is a gold mine in the hunt for the next vegan meat!
