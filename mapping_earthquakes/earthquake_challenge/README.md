## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of the [Earthquake Map](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/aricciardelli2.github.io/tree/master/mapping_earthquakes/earthquake_challenge) is to provide an interactable webpage for users to see real-time information about earthquakes form the past 7 days according to the [USGS](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/).

## User Flow

The [Earthquake Map](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/aricciardelli2.github.io/tree/master/mapping_earthquakes/earthquake_challenge) allows for a user to visualize all earthquakes from the past 7 days on an interactive map and toggle on and off different layers of data as well as use different maps.

### Data Layers
There are 3 different layers of earthquake data that users can turn on and off to visualize the important data layer(s) they want to see. Multiple layers can be turned on at once (or none) and all three layers are turned on by default. These layers are turned on using the check boxes in the map options box in the top right corner. The three layers are the following:

#### Earthquakes
This layer shows all earthquakes from the past 7 days. Users can also click on the earthquake markers to see the magnitude and location of the earthquake.

#### Tectonic Plates
This layer shows the boundaries of the earth's tectonic plates. This information is useful as earthquakes are almost always caused by interactions between these tectonic plates.

#### Major Earthquakes
This layer shows all major earthquakes (Magnitude > 4.5) from the past 7 days. Users can also click on the earthquake markers to see the magnitude and location of the earthquake.

### Map Options
There are also 3 different maps users can use to overlay the earthquake data on. Only one map can be selected at a time and by default the Street map is used. The map can be chosen in the map options box in the top right corner. The three map options are the following:

#### Streets
This map is chosen by default and shows a streets map.

#### Satellite
This map shows satellite imagery of the earth.

#### Dark
This map shows a dark version of the streets map.

## Summary

The [Earthquake Map](https://github.com/aricciardelli2/aricciardelli2.github.io/tree/master/mapping_earthquakes/earthquake_challenge) is a great source for people to use to see real-time earthquake data around the world!
